When we were kids, we used to play Dots & Boxes game (called As `Poojyam Vett` (പൂജ്യം വെട്ട്) in our local language Malayalam) in school. It's still a popular game in school : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes

This is that game made online. It's an online multiplayer implementation of Dots-and-Boxes !
